=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebService::HMRC::Request;

    my $r = WebService::HMRC::Request->new();
    $r->auth->access_token('MY_ACCESS_TOKEN');

    my $response = $r->get_endpoint({
        endpoint => '/hello/user',
        auth_type => 'user',
    });
    print $response->data->{message} if $response->is_success;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl module is a base for a suite of modules used for
interacting with the HMRC Making Tax Digital (MTD) and Making Tax Digital for
Business (MTDfB) APIs.

HMRC is the UK government tax authority. Their APIs
provide a means to submit and query information relating to personal and
business tax and customs affairs.

These base modules will normally not be used directly by an application.
Instead, applications will generally use a higher-level module which inherits
from these classes.

For more information, see:
L<https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api>

=head2 CORE MODULES

This module is distributed with the following low-level modules comprising
the essential core classes for interacting with the API:

=over

=item L<WebService::HMRC::Request>

=item L<WebService::HMRC::Response>

=item L<WebService::HMRC::Authenticate>

=back

=head2 API MODULES

Rather than using the low-level modules directly, applications will generally
use a module specific to the API they wish to access (which will inherit from
the core modules). At the time of writing, the following API modules are
available:

=over

=item L<WebService::HMRC::HelloWorld>

=item L<WebService::HMRC::CreateTestUser>

=item L<WebService::HMRC::VAT>

=back

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

=head1 AUTHORISATION

Except for a small number of open endpoints, access to the HMRC APIs requires
application or user credentials. These must be obtained from HMRC. Application
credentials (and documentation) may be obtained from their
L<Developer Hub|https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation>

=head1 TESTING

The basic tests, as run as part of the installation instructions shown above,
do not require an internet connection or authorisation with HMRC.

Developer pre-release tests may be run with the following command:

    prove -l xt/

With a working internet connection and appropriate HMRC credentials, specified
as environment variables, interaction with the real HMRC sandbox api, using
authorisation, may be tested:

=head2 Test generation of a valid authorisation url

To run these tests:

=over

=item * An application must be registered with HMRC.

=item * The application must be enabled for the 'Hello World' test api with HMRC.

=item * C<urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob> must be set as a valid redirect_uri for the application.

=item * HMRC_CLIENT_ID environment variable must be set (issued when application was registered).

=item * The HMRC sandbox test api endpoints must be functioning.

=back

    HMRC_CLIENT_ID=[MY-CLIENT-ID] prove -l t/04-hmrc-authenticate.t

This test generates a url, shown in the test output, which can be pasted into
a browser to authorise the application and obtain an Authorisation Code for
the following test stage.

=head2 Test token generation and renewal

In addition to the requirements of the test above, the following environment
variables must be set:

=over

=item * HMRC_CLIENT_SECRET (issued when application was registered).

=item * HMRC_AUTH_CODE (obtained after following the authorisation url generated above).

=back

    HMRC_CLIENT_ID=[MY-CLIENT-ID] \
    HMRC_CLIENT_SECRET=[MY-CLIENT_SECRET] \
    HMRC_AUTH_CODE=[MY-AUTH_CODE] \
    prove -l t/04-hmrc-authenticate.t

When successful, this test will output the response from refreshing access
tokens, including new access and refresh tokens.

=head2 Test API Interaction

These tests query the HMRC Hello World API, testing each of the authentication
types and checking for an expected response. Prerequisites must be in place as
for the other tests above and the following environment variables set:

=over

=item * HMRC_SERVER_TOKEN (issued when application was registered)

=item * HMRC_AUTH_CODE (refreshed code output by previous test above)

=back

    HMRC_SERVER_TOKEN=[MY-SERVER-TOKEN] \
    HMRC_AUTH_CODE=[MY-AUTH_CODE] \
    prove -l t/05-hmrc-api.t

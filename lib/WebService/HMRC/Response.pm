=head1 NAME

WebService::HMRC::Response - Response object for the UK HMRC HelloWorld API

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is part of a suite of Perl modules for interacting with the UK's HMRC
Making Tax Digital APIs.

This class represents the response from an api call. It is inherited by
other classes which implement bindings to HMRC APIs rather than being
used directly.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebService::HMRC::HelloWorld;  # inherits this module
    my $hmrc = WebService::HMRC::HelloWorld->new();

    # Hello World endpoint requires no authorisation
    my $hmrc_response = $hmrc->hello_world()

    print "success\n" if $hmrc_response->is_success();

    my $status_code = $hmrc_response->http->code;
    print "api call yielded http response code $status_code\n";

    my $message = $hmrc_response->data->{message};
    print "received: $message\n";
    
=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 data

Reference to a perl hash representing an api call's json response.

This property is updated on object creation when the http property is set.

If an api call returns no valid json response, this property is
populated with a dummy response, in the same format as the standard
HRMC error response, with code 'INVALID_RESPONSE'. This facilitates
consistent error parsing by the calling application.

=cut

has data => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Maybe[HashRef]',
    default => undef,
);

=head2 http

The raw HTTP::Response object resulting from an api call. See documentation
for L<HTTP::Response>.

=cut

has http => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => 'HTTP::Response',
    required => 1,
    trigger => \&_parse_http_response,
    handles => ['is_success'],
);


=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_success()

Shortcut to the HTTP::Response is_success method.

# PRIVATE METHODS

# _parse_http_response($http_response)
#
# Update this class's `data` property to reflect the json content of
# the supplied HTTP::Response object. Returns a reference to the Perl data
# structure representing the json response.

sub _parse_http_response {
    my $self = shift;
    my $http = shift;

    # Under normal conditions, the api always returns json content
    # even for error responses. But unusual error conditions could
    # return content that is invalid json, which will cause the parser
    # to croak. We therefore wrap it in a `try` block.
    my $data = try {
        return decode_json($http->decoded_content);
    }
    catch {
        carp "unable to parse api response as json: $_";

        # Create dummy error message with same format as HMRC
        # error response to facilitate consistent error parsing by
        # calling application.
        return {
            code    => 'INVALID_RESPONSE',
            message => 'No valid JSON data received from api call. '.
                       $http->status_line,
        };
    };

    $self->data($data);
    return $data;
}
